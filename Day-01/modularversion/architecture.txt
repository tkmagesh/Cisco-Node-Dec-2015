OK so my app is currently having code to 
run a server
If a request comes to it based on the url it needs to do processing
if(URL is out of certain formats like html, json etc)
it uses file stream to read and directly write.

For this situation the data is 

the url 
get the url object
from it find the pathname see if it is valid html or file name
even if it is valid file name 
we need to check if file exist fs needs full path

path.join(__dirname,pathname)
